        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Juan Soto and welcome to my TED Talk. 
            Just Kidding, this is my place to show you what I've accomplished as a web developer/software engineer. 
            Growing up, I initially took to technology as a gamer on my NES and Mac computer playing Mario and Mavis Beacon teaches typing. 
            Technology has come a LONG way since then as well as my interest in it. 
            Eventually I took a Cisco Networking class in high school but it wasn't until I attended Bloc, <a href="https://www.ccp.edu/college-catalog/degree-programs/proficiency-certificate/computer-programming-i-application-web-and-database-development-proficiency-certificate?mode=232" target="_blank">Community College of Philadelphia</a>, and <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/talent" target="_blank">LAUNCHCODE</a> all of which provided the tools neccessary for my development and eventual certification in full-stack web development! 
        <p></p>
        <p>That being said, I continue to learn, grow, and look for multiple places to develop, whether solo or in a team environment as I continue on this journey towards my passion and career path. 
            I value and embrace everyone with knowledge of this subject matter!</p>
