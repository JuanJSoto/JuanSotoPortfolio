    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Juan Soto and welcome to my TED Talk. 
        Just Kidding, this is my place to show you what I've accomplished as a web developer/software engineer. 
        Growing up, I initially took to technology as a gamer on my NES and Mac computer playing Mario and Mavis Beacon teaches typing. 
        Technology has come a LONG way since then as well as my interest in it. 
        Eventually I took a Cisco Networking class in high school but it wasn't until I attended Bloc, Community College of Philadelphia, and LaunchCode all of which provided the tools neccessary for my development and eventual certification in full-stack web development! 
      <p></p>
      <p>That being said, I continue to learn, grow, and look for multiple places to develop, whether solo or in a team environment as I continue on this journey towards my passion and career path. 
        I value and embrace everyone with knowledge of this subject matter!</p>
